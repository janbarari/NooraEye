Unit Tests
------
```kotlin
assertDoesNotThrow<NooraEyeExceedMemoryException> {
    assertNooraEye("My Test 1", memoryThresholdInByte = 1000, timeThresholdInMs = 1000) {
        // Fails when memory usage exceeds the threshold
    }
}

assertDoesNotThrow<NooraEyeExceedExecutionException> {
    assertNooraEye("My Test 2", memoryThresholdInByte = 1000, timeThresholdInMs = 1000) {
        // Fails when execution took longer than threshold
    }
}

assertDoesNotThrow<NooraEyeRanOutOfMemoryException> {
    assertNooraEye("My Test 3", memoryThresholdInByte = 1000, timeThresholdInMs = 1000) {
        // Fail when process ran out of memory
    }
}
